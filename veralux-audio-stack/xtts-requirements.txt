# XTTS server: TTS 0.22 does "from transformers import BeamSearchScorer";
# that only works when transformers still exports it at top level (e.g. 4.33).
#
# Pin torch/torchaudio < 2.9 to avoid the torchcodec dependency.
# torchaudio >= 2.9 replaced its audio backend with torchcodec, which has
# no arm64 Linux wheel and requires system FFmpeg.  Versions < 2.9 use the
# built-in soundfile/sox backends and work out of the box on all platforms.
