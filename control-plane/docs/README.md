# VeraLux Receptionist Documentation

This documentation set is written for a mixed audience (operators, admins, and developers). It focuses on the control plane in this repo. The low-latency voice runtime that handles live calls, media, and telephony integrations is separate.

If you are new, start with the Architecture and Configuration guides, then use Deployment and Operations for production setup.
